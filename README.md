Behaviour: The Triangle-Tracker App gives the answers to your questions. All answers about Triangles, so for instance if you put an Input figure like 5,3,6 as the Length, Width, and Height. The Output or the Answer will be scalene. so if its an equilateral it will tell you and if its the other types it will also tell. etc... The Program recognizes length set to zero(0) or is less than zero INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 0 sideB = 60 sideC = 30

OUTPUT EXAMPLE : Length of sides cannot be equal to or less than zero

The Program recognizes lengths that are Equal INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 60 sideB = 60 sideC = 60

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: The Triangle is an EQUILATERAL

The Program recognizes two lengths that are Equal

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 60 sideB = 60 sideC = 30

OUTPUT EXAMPLET: The Triangle is an ISOSCELES

The Program recognizes lengths that are unequal

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 30 sideB = 40 sideC = 60

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: The triangle is a SCALENE

The Program recognizes lengths that do not form a triangle

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 50 sideB = 30 sideC = 90

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: This NOT A TRIANGLE

The Program recognizes empty fields or invalid characters like text

Input : sideA = a sideB = "" sideC = 90

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: TRY AGAIN. EMPTY FIELDS OR WRONG INPUTS
